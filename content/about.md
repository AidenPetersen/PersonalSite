My name is Aiden Petersen, and I'm a computer engineering and math major at Iowa State University.

I originally started programming in Java in my senior year of high school for an AP Computer Science class.
I enjoyed it so much that I decided to do a CS-related major in college. I learned that solving problems
can be fun, something that I didn't experience before.

I learned a lot after high school due to a newfound appreciation for programming, but recently I've taken an interest
in functional programming. I've learned languages like Haskell and Elixir, and I've enjoyed their concise way of solving
problems.

Here's a bunch of the thing's I've spent my time doing:

### Experience
 - **Web Developer** - Iowa State IT - May 2021 - Present
   - Primarily write web applications using php's Laravel and Vue.js.
   - Learned many importand skills like programming in a professional 
     environment and using important version control and productivity tools.
 - **Competitive Programming** - ICPC - Dec 2020 - Present

### Tools
 - **Languages** - Java, C/C++, Python, Haskell, Elixir, SQL (MySQL), PHP, Verilog
 - **Techonologies** - Linux, Git, Vue.js, Laravel, Django

## What I'm Doing Right Now

In between working and taking a physics class this summer, I'm focusing on learning more about elixir. It seems like a
promising language that can solve a lot of problems with its concurrency model. So I'm planning on starting a project using it soon.

I'm also interested in learning more about lower-level languages; specifically, C. C is a bit daunting. I've learned the basics of Make, but the language is so simple yet challenging. I will likely get better at it during my embedded systems class next
semester. I'm looking forwards to it.
