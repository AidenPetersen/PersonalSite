<p>My name is Aiden Petersen, and I&rsquo;m a computer engineering and math major at Iowa State University.</p>
<p>I originally started programming in Java in my senior year of high school for an AP Computer Science class.
I enjoyed it so much that I decided to do a CS-related major in college. I learned that solving problems
can be fun, something that I didn&rsquo;t experience before.</p>
<p>I learned a lot after high school due to a newfound appreciation for programming, but recently I&rsquo;ve taken an interest
in functional programming. I&rsquo;ve learned languages like Haskell and Elixir, and I&rsquo;ve enjoyed their concise way of solving
problems.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a bunch of the thing&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve spent my time doing:</p>
<h3 id="experience">Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web Developer</strong> - Iowa State IT - May 2021 - Present
<ul>
<li>Primarily write web applications using php&rsquo;s Laravel and Vue.js.</li>
<li>Learned many importand skills like programming in a professional
environment and using important version control and productivity tools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Competitive Programming</strong> - ICPC - Dec 2020 - Present</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Languages</strong> - Java, C/C++, Python, Haskell, Elixir, SQL (MySQL), PHP, Verilog</li>
<li><strong>Techonologies</strong> - Linux, Git, Vue.js, Laravel, Django</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-im-doing-right-now">What I&rsquo;m Doing Right Now</h2>
<p>In between working and taking a physics class this summer, I&rsquo;m focusing on learning more about elixir. It seems like a
promising language that can solve a lot of problems with its concurrency model. So I&rsquo;m planning on starting a project using it soon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also interested in learning more about lower-level languages; specifically, C. C is a bit daunting. I&rsquo;ve learned the basics of Make, but the language is so simple yet challenging. I will likely get better at it during my embedded systems class next
semester. I&rsquo;m looking forwards to it.</p>
